## House Price Predicition

This is a regression problem with available features of houses to predict house prices. This page documents the steps and thinking process I took to solve this problem. I scored top 10% at the competition. The detailed code is in Jupyter Notebooks in this repository.

### Project Steps
- Step 1: Understand Data
- Step 2: Create Baseline Score
- Step 3: Feature Engineering
- Step 4: Explore Linear Models
- Step 5: Explore Tree Based Models
- Step 6: Stacked Models

### Step 1: Understand Data
The data information is given by the competition. The dataset has 2919 entries of vairous information of houses and their respective sale prices. The dataset is split into a training set of 1460 entries and a test set of 1459 entries. Each sample has 79 features, including diverse information, such as total square footage, number of bedrooms, and quality of materials. 

### Step 2: Create Baseline Score
First, I want to generate a baseline score using a basic model and mininum feature engineering. Future improvements can then be made based on the score.
