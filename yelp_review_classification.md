## Yelp Review Classification (WIP)

[Go back to the Main Page](index.md)

For this project, I will perform a binary classification on Yelp reviews and predict whether a review is positive or negative. 


### Project Steps:
- Step 1: Extract Reviews and Ratings
- Step 2: Bags-of-Words Method
- Step 3: Word Embeddings and LSTM


### Step 1 & 2:
Check out [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/willchenyh/yelp_review_analysis/blob/master/Yelp%20Review%20Classification.ipynb) for details.


### Step 3:
Check out [this program](https://github.com/willchenyh/yelp_review_analysis/blob/master/review_classification_lstm.py) for details
